        AgeJet is a dramatically different, safe, and FDA-cleared skin
        resurfacing procedure for the face, neck, décolletage, hands, body and
        external vaginal area. Just one AgeJet treatment will significantly
        improve skin quality. It is unique in its ability to safely treat the
        upper and lower eyelids resulting it what many people describe as a
        “non-surgical blepharoplasty”. Unlike laser procedures which require
        corneal shields, the plasma energy delivered to the eyelid tissue does
        not penetrate through to the eye, making this procedure incredibly safe
        all the way up to the eyelash margin. The results are consistent and
        dramatic leaving you with a natural more refreshed appearance.
